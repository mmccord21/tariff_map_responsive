1. Create the Environment
It's assumed you have a Conda distribution (like Miniconda or Anaconda) installed and have already cloned the project repository.

Navigate to the project's root directory in your anaconda terminal.
Create the environment from the provided YAML file. This command sets up an isolated environment with all the necessary dependencies defined in environment.yml.
conda env create --file environment.yml

2. Run the Script
Activate the newly created environment. Your shell prompt will update to reflect the active environment.
conda activate tariff_map_responsive

Execute the Python script.
python data/data_manipulation.py

The script will now process the data, and any specified output files will be generated in the data/ directory.
